# PDF-JS-Vue

*"PJV" - A PDF viewer for the web, utilizing Vue.js and Mozilla's PDF.js*

## Background

Mozilla's **PDF.js** is the defacto standard for reading PDFs with JavaScript, but it's viewer is not modular and is not made to be imported into other web projects easily. **Vue** is an easy-to-use, modern framework, and can be brought into other websites without much trouble.
